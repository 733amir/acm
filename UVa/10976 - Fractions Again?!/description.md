## 10976 - Fractions Again?!

If we want to use `1/k = 1/x + 1/y` we have so search for `x` and `y`.

By changing `1/k = 1/x + 1/y` to `x = (y * k) / (y - k)` we just need to search for those `y`s in this equation that `x` will be an integer. `y` is ranged from `k + 1` to an integer which the equation result (`x`) will be equal to `y` (because of `1/k = 1/2k + 1/2k`).
